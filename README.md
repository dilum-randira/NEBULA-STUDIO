# 🌌 Nebula Studio

**Nebula Studio** is an interactive 3D particle visualizer built with Three.js and MediaPipe Hand Tracking. It transforms a standard webcam into a spatial controller, allowing users to manipulate digital matter in real time using natural hand gestures.

---

## 🚀 Overview

Nebula Studio renders a high-performance GPU-accelerated particle system that reacts directly to physical hand movement.  
Using real-time computer vision, the application tracks precise hand landmarks to infer distance, motion, and intent.

Users can sculpt, attract, repel, and morph thousands of particles into dynamic 3D forms, creating fluid, immersive visual experiences directly in the browser.

## ✨ Features

### 🤖 AI Hand Tracking
- Real-time hand landmark detection using MediaPipe
- Low-latency gesture recognition via webcam
- No external hardware required

### ✋ Gesture Interaction
- **Pinch Gesture** → Attracts particles toward the hand  
- **Open Palm** → Repels particles outward

### 🌠 Dynamic Particle Templates
- **Lotus Bloom** – Organic flower-like growth animation  
- **Supernova** – Explosive, firework-style particle burst  
- **Saturn Rings** – Rotating planetary ring system  
- **Heart Core** – Parametric heart-shaped particle form  
- **Cosmic Cloud** – Free-flowing procedural particle field  

### 🎯 Smooth Interaction
- Exponential Moving Average (EMA) filtering
- Reduces jitter from low-quality or noisy webcams
- Ensures stable, fluid motion
